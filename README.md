# RayTracing_CS130
This repository contains the work from UCR CS130 course project RayTracing.

This is an implementation of a basic ray tracer.
In this implementation we have done the following:
  1. flat shading
  2. sphere, plane, cylinder intersections
  3. casting rays
  4. coordinate system orientation
  5. color 
  6. camera orientation
  7. recursion depth
  8. reflections 
  9. lighting and shadows
  10. unions and differences
